                YELLOW LINES mark the center of a two-way road used for two-way traffic. 
                You may pass on a two-way road if the yellow centerline is broken. 
                When a solid and a broken yellow line are together, you must not pass 
                if you are driving next to the solid line. Two solid yellow lines mean no passing.

                The typical Italian Gothic building, the Cathedral of Florence, 
                is dedicated to "Santa Maria del Fiore". The church was designed 
                by Arnolfo di Cambio (c1245-1302) who considerably enlarged the 
                existing religious structure. Finished around 1367, the Cathedral 
                was completely covered by coloured marbles like the earlier Baptistery, 
                except for the façade that remained unfinished and was terminated only 
                in the 19th century.

                Basilisks commonly live along streams and will run quickly across the water 
                on their hind legs when frightened. They are commonly called “Jesus Christ” 
                lizards because of this trait. The animal’s speed, light weight, and possession 
                of broadscale fringes on the toes keep it from sinking into the water during a sprint; 
                however, it is usually the younger and lighter lizards that are seen running across the 
                surface of the water. Basilisks are also good swimmers, and adults may remain underwater 
                up to 30 minutes before resurfacing.
